- Deactivate your enviroment
- Delete your environment

## Lab 1: Image Processing Fundamentals in Python
**Learning Objectives**
1.1:
- use cv2 to load and show images in rgb and grayscale
- see image properties
- understand how you can use image properties to create transformations across image

## Lab 2:
- histogram equalization
- Convolutions and Kernels
- Name common kernels
- Analyze how kernels affect the image

### ASIDE
- getting jupyter lab together 
- opening lab 3 in jupyter lab

## Lab 3: Misc
- What medical imaging data is
- 

## Lab 4: Image Segmentation
 
    Object detection vs instance segmentation vs semantic segmentation
    Exploring tools used to annotate images for label generation
    Learning traditional methods: Atlas-based, thresholding-based, and watershed-based methods
